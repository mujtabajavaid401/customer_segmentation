# Overview

Retail sector either it be online or not, generate a large amount of data i.e customer transactions, on day-to day bases.This data can be analysed for to force trends  that could highlighting the potential customers as in grouping customers into various segments, considering which important strategies can be developed i.e communication means to address the target audience.

All this is beneficial in respect to improving the relationship between the customers as they get to avail better offers as business tend to promote them to enhance their revenue or market share by means of increasing their sale.

Businesses or very keen to use these strategies as this allow them, to stay ahead of competitors and lead to development of new products, considering customerâ€™s interest.

Types of Segementation:

Demographic, addresses gender, age, martial status and occupation.
Geographic , addresses location, region and urban or rural area.

In the first section of the code I am trying assign customers to particular segments by using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)  analysis which is mainly behavior-based approach to group customers into particular segments.customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions in terms of  how recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. RFM filters customers into various groups for the purpose of better service.There is a segment of customer who is the big spender but what if they purchased only once or how recently they purchased? Do they often purchase our product? 

All this helps managers to identify potential customers to do more profitable business i.e by running an effective promotional campaign for personalized service.
